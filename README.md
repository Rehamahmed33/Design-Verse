Project Idea

Our project is a mobile application designed to reinvent the online flower shopping experience. Instead of functioning only as a digital catalog that sells bouquets, the app introduces multiple innovative features. These include personalized recommendations powered by AI, an augmented reality (AR) preview that allows users to visualize bouquets in their own space before purchasing, flexible subscription plans for weekly or monthly deliveries, and a unique flower recycling initiative to promote sustainability. By combining technology with creativity, the application aims to make flower shopping more engaging, convenient, and meaningful, while also standing out from existing competitors.
